                    <p>
                        I am a recent graduate from the University of Ibadan,
                        where I earned my Bachelor of Arts degree in Islamic
                        Studies in 2019. My passion for technology led me to
                        start learning web development on my own and I fully
                        immersed myself in the field in 2021/22. I am
                        self-taught but have also participated in several
                        programs, such as the Google Africa Developer
                        Scholarship and the i4g & Zuri Internship, to enhance my
                        skills and gain hands-on experience. These opportunities
                        have allowed me to grow both personally and
                        professionally and I am excited to continue on this
                        journey

                    <h3 class="text-xl font-bold">Professional Background</h3>
                    <p>
                        Prior to my career in technology, I have had a diverse
                        professional background with experience in both sales
                        and operations. I started my career as a Direct Sales
                        Executive at United Bank for Africa, where I
                        successfully sold the bank's products, met monthly
                        targets, and helped manage customer accounts.
                        <br>I then
                        joined Graceco, an FMCG company, as a Graduate Trainee
                        and later became the Receiving Officer. During my time
                        at Graceco, I demonstrated my teamwork skills and honed
                        my leadership abilities. <br> Most recently, I worked at KPMG
                        as a Field Forensics Officer for the Nigerian National
                        Petroleum Corporation (NNPC). In this role, I conducted
                        audits and identified process gaps, and made
                        recommendations for nationwide improvements. These
                        experiences have allowed me to develop strong analytical
                        and problem-solving skills and a commitment to quality
                        work."
